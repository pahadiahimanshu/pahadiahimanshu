JavaScript is one of the top {% include link-new-tab.html text='in-demand programming languages ' link='https://stackify.com/popular-programming-languages-2018/' %} in 2017-18 and the most popular one on GitHub with over 2,300,000 pull requests.

Considering a long list of JavaScript libraries available online, it's always laborious to find the best one. So, I've curated a list of handpicked libraries that are best for web development. I'll not be listing all the popular frameworks like JQuery, ReactJs, NodeJs, VueJs etc. This post will be focusing on the libraries that can make your web development project a lot easier and feature-packed at the same time.

Note: Some of the libraries have JQuery as dependency. And some might only work with other Js frameworks like ExpressJs, NodeJs.

#### Snap.svg

The Snap.svg JavaScript library makes working with SVG assets as easy as jQuery makes working with the DOM. 
It's a powerful API for animating and manipulating both existing SVG content, and SVG content generated with Snap. Snap supports features like masking, clipping, patterns, full gradients, groups, and more.
