Until the mid to late 1970s, the manufacturers didn’t really care for the computer interfaces. The few people who had access to computers were professionals or academics. Since the user base was small, it wasn’t necessary to focus on how the users interacted with the computers.   

With the dawn of personal computing, the area of interaction opened. All the major players, Xerox, Apple, IBM, started designing their version of the keyboard and mouse. In the 1980s, the discipline of human-computer interaction was born with a single objective; making computing easier for the masses.   

Whenever there is a paradigm shift, it drives humans to innovate new technologies. And Innovating new products is essential to the progression of society. We are currently facing a similar shift, the rising use of smartphones, tablets, VR, AR devices, smartwatches and smart home gadgets have made the keyboard and mouse impractical. And just like every time, we are innovating. There are a couple of technologies and products that are all set to replace our traditional keyboard and mouse. And all these new ways of interactions have their pros and cons, some claim to be faster, some claim to be easier and some work where others just can’t. Let’s explore the future of interacting with computing devices.
