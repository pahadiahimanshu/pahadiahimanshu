A delivery crowdsourcing application that enables a easy and hassle-free intra-campus delivery system. (Currently only for food)

**Aim -**

To develop a human-centered application that is easy and convinient to use.

**Features -**

*   Get food delivered to your location and pay the cost for food only. To pay delivery charges, use the in-app virtual currency **"super coins"**.
*   Earn the virtual currency by delivering food to those in-need.
*   Easy to order from the menu provided by canteen and in-campus cafe.
*   Easy to deliver and earn super coins from a dedicated marketplace which shows all live orders.

**Process -**

*   After rigorous ideation and contextual inquiries, we created an affinity diagram on the basis of responses by students.

After the affinity diagram, we designed a low-fidelity prototype and did task analysis with students. Then as per iterative process, we refined the design and finally developed the android application.
