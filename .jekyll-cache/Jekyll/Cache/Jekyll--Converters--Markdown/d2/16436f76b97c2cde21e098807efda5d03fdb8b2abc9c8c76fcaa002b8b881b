I"á<p>Some people love reading, some love writing and some both. I love creating things, things that people can experience and understand the ideas that fuel them. People who usually start blogs are passionate about writing. I, on the other hand, am passionate about technology, building new software, games and virtual environments.</p>

<p>I have quite a few reasons why I am starting this blog -</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The world is full of knowledge</strong><br />
I‚Äôm one of those people who cannot learn something without practically using it. That‚Äôs a reason why I hate theory classes.<br />
I‚Äôm always curious about new tools and how I can use them to build utility for people. The internet is full of knowledge, new tools and languages. To keep myself motivated towards learning new things, I always wanted to make a journal where I can take notes and remember what I learnt in the past. But the point of keeping it online is feedback - If I make a mistake, people can always correct me. This blog will serve as a stimulus to my thirst for learning.</li>
  <li><strong>It‚Äôs a challenge</strong><br />
Blogging is a challenge, the people who do it regularly, invest in themselves, spend hours learning and writing about new topics. Instead of procastinating, I wanted to spend my time on personal growth. If something‚Äôs not challenging enough, I might not take out time to do it.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sharing is caring</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‚ÄúThe great aim of education is not knowledge but action.‚Äù - Herbert Spencer</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Although not the primary intent for this blog, it‚Äôs an important reason why I wanted to start it. Like most of the individuals, I learn by doing it. But another good way to learn something is by teaching it.<br />
<strong>If I am able to help just one person, then it‚Äôs enough, and this blog has served its purpose.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Connect</strong><br />
It‚Äôs always an amazing feeling to have an obscure idea and then have some random person share about the same experience online. Meeting new people passionate about the same things I am is always great.</li>
</ul>
