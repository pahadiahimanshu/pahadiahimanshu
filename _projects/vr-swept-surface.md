Virtual Reality is by far seen as a creative and artistic medium. Drawing and sculpting is hence of prime importance in the future of VR. Most of the papers and applications available take the concept of freehand sketching for mostly design purposes in VR. However freehand sketching is not usefull for making smooth surfaces for the purpose of modelling.

An implementation of the algorithm stated in ['Interactive swept surface modeling in virtual reality with motion-tracked controllers'](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3092908) by Tim McGraw, Esteban Garcia and Drew Summer (Purdue University) which was published in SBIM'17.
