				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>Hey, I'm a 22-year-old computer science graduate from <a href="https://iiitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology</a>, Delhi. I like developing software, designing graphics and drinking coffee.</p>
				<p>I believe learning should never stop, which is why I keep exploring new programming languages, tools and technologies. I've acquired a variety of skills over the past years like web, android, java, virtual reality, computer graphics, 3D design, prototyping, user-experience and graphic design.</p>
